I would like to make a git repo for each language+testFramework combination.
This would include the visible-files at startup and the Dockerfile +context files
(eg .jar files).
A problem with this is that start-point create has to clone from a git repo
and I don't want to clone the Dockerfile stuff I only want the visible-files stuff.
I think this is possible.
For example, suppose I wanted to only git clone the app/ dir of
https://github.com/cyber-dojo/web.git
here's what I'd need to do

mkdir partial
cd partial
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/cyber-dojo/web.git
git config core.sparseCheckout true
echo "app/" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull --depth=1 origin master
rm -rf .git
