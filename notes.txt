...start-point create --dir=DIR...

suppose cyber-dojo script runs locally and delegates to cyber-dojo.sh
inside a commaner container. The commander contains will NOT be
able to see the default's file-system. You will be inside a container
running on default.
So I *still* have to handle start-point-create locally!

Any copied files have to live directly on default.
So. Wherever cyber-dojo is being run, DIR has to exist.
On Linux/Mac that is locally.

On Windows you'll do...
docker-machine ssh default -- ./cyber-dojo ...
And DIR has to exist on default.


Alternative is that known folder is always mounted
and DIR has to be relative to that...?
