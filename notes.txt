...start-point create --dir=DIR...

suppose cyber-dojo script runs locally and delegates to cyber-dojo.sh
inside a commaner container. The commander container will NOT be
able to see the default's file-system. You will be inside a container
running on default.
So I *still* have to handle start-point-create locally!

Any copied files have to live directly on default.
So. Wherever cyber-dojo is being run, DIR has to exist.
On Linux/Mac that is locally.

On Windows you'll do...
docker-machine ssh default -- ./cyber-dojo ...
And DIR has to exist on default.

-------------------------------------------

Get commander up and working without further internal refactoring.
  - Recreate image from Dockerfile.
  - Use shunit2 for tests? Or do inside a container and use Ruby?
    - sh
    - update
    - start-point create NAME ---dir=DIR
Make separate setup pages for
  Linux - install docker, install cyber-dojo script
  Mac- install Docker-Toolbox. Install and run cyber-dojo script locally
  Windows - install Docker-Toolbox. Install and run cyber-dojo script inside default.
