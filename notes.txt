Installed DockerToolbox on Windows 10 Pro laptop.
Opened Docker Quickstart Terminal
downloaded cyber-dojo script
$ ./cyber-dojo up

Trying it on Chrome...YES
Trying it on Firefox...YES
Trying it on Opera...YES
Trying it on Edge... NO

So clearly edge is not giving access to 192.168.99.100

Suggests it might be a anti-virus/security/firewall issue.

Scrolling down a bit it mentioned Edge...
Tried that
Nope

Suggestion is to command below in terminal
Right click on Start menu, open Terminal as Admin, run
CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n=Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe
Still no access
